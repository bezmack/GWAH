You probably should follow these steps to play:

1. go to bit.ly/gwagainsthumanity


2. click on Signup in top right of page


3. signup with your info (you'd think this was self explanatory...)


4. click on Login and enter your info (noticing a theme here?)


5. enter your player name in the small white box on the left and click "Enter Game"


6. wait for the other idiots to do the same until there are four of you (god help us)


7. the Card Czar will start the game with a black card which will appear on your screen


8. pick a funny white card to play by clicking on the text in the box you want to choose


9. pray that you're funny enough to win and that the Card Czar picks your card as the winner


10. the winner will see a point added on the left side of the screen
      (nice try...maybe you'll get 'em next time champ)
